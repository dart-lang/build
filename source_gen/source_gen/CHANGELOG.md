## 0.5.10+1

* Update minimum `analyzer` package to `0.29.10`.

## 0.5.10

* Bug fixes:
  * Do not fail when "library" is omitted but nothing would be output.
  * Do not fail on extensions that don't end in ".dart" (valid use case).

## 0.5.9

* Update the minimum Dart SDK to `1.22.1`.
* Deprecated `builder.dart`: import `source_gen.dart` instead.
* Added `TypeChecker`, a high-level API for performing static type checks:

  ```dart
  import 'package:analyzer/dart/element/type.dart';
  import 'package:source_gen/source_gen.dart';
  
  void checkType(DartType dartType) {
    // Checks compared to runtime type `SomeClass`.
    print(const TypeChecker.forRuntime(SomeClass).isExactlyType(dartType));
    
    // Checks compared to a known Url/Symbol:
    const TypeChecker.forUrl('package:foo/foo.dart#SomeClass');
    
    // Checks compared to another resolved `DartType`:
    const TypeChecker.forStatic(anotherDartType);
  }
  ```

* Failing to add a `library` directive to a library that is being used as a
  generator target that generates partial files (`part of`) is now an explicit
  error that gives a hint on how to name and fix your library:
  
  ```bash
  > Could not find library identifier so a "part of" cannot be built.
  >
  > Consider adding the following to your source file:
  >
  > "library foo.bar;"
  ```
  
  In Dart SDK `>=1.25.0` this can be relaxed as `part of` can refer to a path.
  To opt-in, `GeneratorBuilder` now has a new flag, `requireLibraryDirective`.
  Set it to `false`, and also set your `sdk` constraint appropriately:
  
  ```yaml
    sdk: '>=1.25.0 <2.0.0'
  ```

* Added `LibraryReader`, a utility class for `LibraryElement` that exposes
  high-level APIs, including `findType`, which traverses `export` directives
  for publicly exported types. For example, to find `Generator` from
  `package:source_gen/source_gen.dart`:
  
  ```dart
  void example(LibraryElement pkgSourceGen) {
    var library = new LibraryReader(pkgSourceGen);
  
    // Instead of pkgSourceGen.getType('Generator'), which is null.
    library.findType('Generator');
  }
  ```

* Added `ConstantReader`, a high-level API for reading from constant (static)
  values from Dart source code (usually represented by `DartObject` from the
  `analyzer` package):
  
  ```dart
  abstract class ConstantReader {
    factory ConstantReader(DartObject object) => ...
  
    // Other methods and properties also exist.
  
    /// Reads[ field] from the constant as another constant value.
    ConstantReader read(String field);
  
    /// Reads [field] from the constant as a boolean.
    ///
    /// If the resulting value is `null`, uses [defaultTo] if defined.
    bool readBool(String field, {bool defaultTo()});
  
    /// Reads [field] from the constant as an int.
    ///
    /// If the resulting value is `null`, uses [defaultTo] if defined.
    int readInt(String field, {int defaultTo()});
  
    /// Reads [field] from the constant as a string.
    ///
    /// If the resulting value is `null`, uses [defaultTo] if defined.
    String readString(String field, {String defaultTo()});
  }
  ```

## 0.5.8

  run

## 0.5.3+1

* Don't throw when running against a non-library asset and getting no
  LibraryElement

## 0.5.3

  use-at-your-own-risk since it is not guaranteed to be stable
* Internal cleanup
  * Drop some unused utility methods
  * Move cli_util to dev_dependencies
  * Avoid some deprecated analyzer apis
  * Syntax tweaks
  * Drop results.dart which had no usages

## 0.5.2

## 0.5.0+2

* Remove an outdated work-around.

* Make strong-mode clean.

## 0.5.0+1

* Support the latest version of `pkg/build`.

## 0.5.0

* **Breaking**: Switch to the `build` package for running `Generator`s. This
  means that the top level `build` and `generate` functions are no longer
  available, and have been replaced by the top level `build`, `watch`, and
  `serve` functions from the `build` package, and the `GeneratorBuilder` class.
  See `tool/build.dart`, `tool/watch.dart`, and `tool/phases.dart` for usage.

  * Note that the `build` package is experimental, and likely to change.

* **Breaking**: The build package provides an abstraction for reading/writing
  files via the `BuildStep` class, and that is now also provided to
  `Generator#generate` and `GeneratorForAnnotation#generateForAnnotatedElement`
  as a second argument.

* Timestamps are no longer included in generated code.

* There is no longer a need to specify the files related to an individual
  generator via `AssociatedFileSet`. Simply use the `BuildStep` instance to read
  and write files and the `build` package will track any files you read in and
  run incremental rebuilds as necessary.
