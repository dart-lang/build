## Overview

`source_gen` provides utilities for automated source code generation for Dart:

* A **tool** for generating code that is part of your Dart project.
* A **framework** for creating and using multiple code generators in a single
  project.
* A **convention** for human and tool generated Dart code to coexist with clean
  separation.

It's main purpose is to expose a developer-friendly API on top of lower-level
packages like the [analyzer](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/analyzer) or
[build][]. You don't _have_ to use `source_gen` in order to generate source code;
we also expose a set of library APIs that might be useful in your generators.

## Quick Start Guide

Because `source_gen` is a package, not an executable, it should be included as
a dependency in your project. If you are creating a generator for others to use
(for example, a JSON serialization generator) or a library that builds on top
of `source_gen` include it in your [pubspec `dependencies`][pub_deps]:

```yaml
dependencies:
  source_gen:
```

If you're only using `source_gen` in your own project to generate code, and
then you publish that code (generated code included), then you can simply add
as a `dev_dependency`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  source_gen:
```

[pub_deps]: https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/dependencies
  
Once you have `source_gen` setup, you should reference the examples below.

## Creating a generator

Extend the `Generator` or `GeneratorForAnnotation` class and `source_gen` will
call your generator for a Dart library or for each element within a library
tagged with the annotation you are interested in.

## Running generators

`source_gen` is based on the [`build`][build] package. Use a `PartBuilder` or
`LibraryBuilder` to wrap your `Generator` as a `Builder` which can be run using
a build system compatible with `package:build`. See the build package
documentation for information on running Builders.

## FAQ

### What is the difference between `source_gen` and [`build`][build]?

Build is a platform-agnostic framework for Dart asset or code generation that
is pluggable into multiple build systems including
[barback (pub/dart transformers)][build_barback], [bazel][bazel_codegen], and
standalone tools like [build_runner][]. You could also build your own.

Meanwhile, `source_gen` provides an API and tooling that is easily usable on
top of `build` to make common tasks easier and more developer friendly. For
example the [`PartBuilder`][api:PartBuilder] class wraps one or more
[`Generator`][api:Generator] instances to make a [`Builder`][api:Builder] which
creates `part of` files, while the [`LibraryBuilder`][api:LibraryBuilder] class
wraps a single Generator to make a `Builder` which creates Dart library files.

### What is the difference between `source_gen` and transformers?

[Dart transformers][] are often used to create and modify code and assets as part
of a Dart project.

Transformers allow modification of existing code and encapsulates changes by
having developers use `pub` commands – `run`, `serve`, and `build`.
Unfortunately the API exposed by transformers hinder fast incremental builds,
output caching, and predictability, so we introduced _builders_ as part of
[`package:build`][build].

Builders and `source_gen` provide for a different model: outputs _must_ be
declared ahead of time and code is generated and updated as part of a project.
It is designed to create *part* _or_ standalone files that augment developer
maintained Dart libraries. For example [AngularDart][angular2] uses `build` and
`source_gen` to "compile" HTML and annotation metadata into plain `.dart` code.

Unlike _transformers_, generated code **MAY** be checked in as part of your
project source, although the decision may vary depending on project needs.

Generated code **SHOULD** be included when publishing a project as a *pub
package*. The fact that `source_gen` is used in a package is an *implementation
detail*.
