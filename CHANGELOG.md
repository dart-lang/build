# Changelog

## 0.3.0+1
- Fix an AssetGraph bug where generated nodes might be created as non-generated
  nodes if they are attempted to be read from previous build steps.

## 0.3.0
- **BREAKING** Renamed values of three enums to be lower-case:
  `BuildType`, `BuildStatus`, and `PackageDependencyType`.
- Updated to crypto ^1.0.0.
- Added option to resolve additional entry points in `buildStep.resolve`.
- Added option to pass in a custom `Resolvers` instance.

## 0.2.1
- Added the `deleteFilesByDefault` option to all top level methods. This will
  skip the prompt to delete files, and instead act as if you responded `y`.
  - Also by default in a non-console environment the prompt no longer exists and
    it will instead just exit with an error.
- Added support for multiple build scripts. Each script now has its own asset
  graph based on a hash of the script uri.
  - You need to be careful here, as you can get in an infinite loop if two
    separate build scripts keep triggering updates for each other.
  - There is no explicit link between multiple scripts, so they operate as if
    all changes from other scripts were user edits. This will usually just do
    the "right thing", but may result in undesired behavior in some
    circumstances.
- Improved logging for non-posix consoles.

## 0.2.0
- Updated the top level classes to take a `PhaseGroup` instead of a
  `List<List<Phase>>`.
- Added logic to handle nested package directories.
- Basic windows support added, although it may still be unstable.
- Significantly increased the resolving speed by using the same sources cache.
- Added a basic README.
- Moved the `.build` folder to `.dart_tool/build`. Other packages in the future
  may also use this folder.

## 0.1.4
- Added top level `serve` function.
  - Just like `watch`, but it provides a server which blocks on any ongoing
    builds before responding to requests.
- Minor bug fixes.

## 0.1.3
- Builds are now fully incremental, even on startup.
  - Builds will be invalidated if the build script or any of its dependencies
    are updated since there is no way of knowing how that would affect things.
- Added `lastModified` to `AssetReader` (only matters if you implement it).

## 0.1.2
- Exposed the top level `watch` function. This can be used to watch the file
  system and run incremental rebuilds on changes.
  - Initial build is still non-incremental.

## 0.1.1

- Exposed the top level `build` function. This can be used to run builds.
  - For this release all builds are non-incremental, and delete all previous
    build outputs when they start up.
  - Creates a `.build` directory which should be added to your `.gitignore`.
- Added `resolve` method to `BuildStep` which can give you a `Resolver` for an
  `AssetId`.
  - This is experimental and may get moved out to a separate package.
  - Resolves the full dart sdk so this is slow, first call will take multiple
    seconds. Subsequent calls are much faster though.
  - Will end up marking all transitive deps as dependencies, so your files may
    end up being recompiled often when not entirely necessary (once we have
    incremental builds).
- Added `listAssetIds` to `AssetReader` (only matters if you implement it).
- Added `delete` to `AssetWriter` (also only matters if you implement it).
