Thank you for taking the time to file an issue!

In order to route, prioritize, and act on this as soon as possible please include:

* Dart SDK Version (`dart --version`)
* What package(s) from this repo you are using, and the version (i.e. `build_runner 0.7.12`)
  * _If you are not sure, try checking your `pubspec.lock` file._
* What builder(s) you are using (or writing yourself). Try to give a short summary of what they do.
* Whether you are using Windows, MacOSX, or Linux (if applicable)
* Whether you are using Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge (if applicable)
* Any other packages or constraints we should know about

Missing some or all of the above might make the issue take longer or be impossible to act on.
