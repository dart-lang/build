These packages provide utilities for generating Dart code.

## Build

### Interfaces

Defines the basic pieces of how a build happens and how they interact.

### Runner

Provides `build` and `watch` utilities to enact builds.

### Barback

Allows wrapping up a `Builder` as a `Transformer` so that it can be run in `pub`
or vice-versa.

## Build Test

Stub implementations for classes in `Build` and some utilities for running
instances of builds and checking their outputs.
