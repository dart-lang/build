This package provides a way of generating files using Dart code, outside of
`pub`. These files are generated directly on disk in the current package folder,
and rebuilds are _incremental_.

## Differences between the `build` package and `pub`.

You might be asking, why use this package instead of a pub `Transformer`? There
are a few key differences that make this package better for some use cases.

### Outputs

Pub will only ever output files into your `build` directory, and pub serve only
ever outputs them into an in-memory file system. With the `build` package, you
can output files anywhere in the current package.

This enables you to generate dart files which are imported by your project,
without getting any warnings about missing files from the analyzer. At the same
time it enables you to easily go explore those files in your editor, and set
breakpoints inside those files.

### Inputs

With `build`, you can use any file from any package you depend on as a primary
input, where with `pub` you can only use files from your current package.

### Consistency

You can't overwrite any pre-existing files using `build`, you can only generate
new ones.

In pub a transformer could overwrite a file any number of times, and this can
lead to confusion and difficulty when debugging, especially with source maps.

### Incremental builds

The `build` package does incremental builds whenever possible. It may decide to
do a full rebuild due to changes in your build script (or one of its deps), or
if you delete the cache folder, but those things shouldn't happen often.

With `pub`, some transformations on your package dependencies may be cached, but
any transformations on your current package are always redone each time you call
`pub build` or `pub serve`. In serve mode it will do incremental builds once the
first build has run, but if you restart it then you have to start over from
scratch.

### Execution modes and reflection

Most frameworks that use reflection today enable running in two different modes,
one which uses `dart:mirrors` for development in dartium, and one which uses
static code generated by a `Transformer` for deployment. All features that use
reflection have to be implemented in both modes, and bugs might exist in only
one mode. This all ends up resulting in obscure deployment time only issues,
as well as a lot of wasted cycles testing the same app in multiple different
modes.

With `build`, you can eliminate entirely the `dart:mirrors` mode. You are always
using the generated code, all the time. This makes it easier on framework devs,
and easier on users who have fewer modes to support.

## Running Builds

In order to run a build, you write a script which uses one of the three top
level functions defined by this library:

- **build**: Runs a single build and exits.
- **watch**: Continuously runs builds as you edit files.
- **serve**: Same as `watch`, but also provides a basic file server which blocks
    if there are ongoing builds.

All three of these methods have a single required argument, a `PhaseGroup`. This
is conceptually just a `List<Phase>` with some helper methods. Each of these
`Phase`s runs sequentially, and blocks until the previous `Phase` is completed.

A single `Phase` may be composed of one or more `BuildAction`s, which are just
a combination of a single `Builder` and a single `InputSet`. The `Builder` is
what will actually generate outputs, and the `InputSet` determines what the
primary inputs to that `Builder` will be. All `BuildAction`s in a `Phase` can
be ran at the same time, and cannot read in the outputs of any other
`BuildAction` in the same `Phase`.

Lets look at a very simple example, with a single `BuildAction`. You can ignore
the `CopyBuilder` for now, just know that its a `Builder` which copies files:

```dart
import 'package:build/build.dart';

main() async {
  /// The [PhaseGroup#singleAction] constructor is a shorthand for:
  ///
  ///   new PhaseGroup().newPhase().addAction(builder, inputSet);
  await build(new PhaseGroup.singleAction(
      new CopyBuilder('.copy'), new InputSet('my_package', ['lib/*.dart'])));
}
```

The above example would copy all `*.dart` files directly under `lib` to
corresponding `*.dart.copy` files. Each time you run a build, it will check for
any changes to the input files, and rerun the `CopyBuilder` only for the inputs
that actually changed.

You can add as many actions as you want to the first phase using the `addAction`
method, and they will all run at the same time. For example, you could make
multiple copies:

```dart
main() async {
  var inputs = new InputSet('my_package', ['lib/*.dart']);
  await build(new PhaseGroup().newPhase()
      ..addAction(new CopyBuilder('.copy1'), inputs)
      ..addAction(new CopyBuilder('.copy2'), inputs));
}
```

Lets say however, that you want to make a copy of one of your copies. Since
no action can read outputs of another action in the same phase, you need to add
an additional `Phase`:

```dart
main() async {
  var phases = new PhaseGroup();
  group.newPhase().addAction(
      new CopyBuilder('.copy'), new InputSet('my_package', ['lib/*.dart']));
  group.newPhase().addAction(
      new CopyBuilder('.bak'), new InputSet('my_package', ['lib/*.dart.copy']));

  await build(phases);
}
```

This time, all the `*.dart.copy` files will be created first, and then the next
`Phase` will read those in and create additional `*.dart.copy.bak` files. You
can add as many phases as you want, but in general it's better to add more
actions to a single phase since they can run at the same time.

**Note**: Any time you change your build script (or any of its dependencies),
the next build will be a full rebuild. This is because the system has no way
of knowing how that change may have affected the outputs.

### Inputs

Valid inputs follow the general dart package rules. You can read any files under
the top level `lib` folder any package dependency, and you can read all files
from the current package.

In general it is best to be as specific as possible with your `InputSet`s,
because all matching files will be provided to `declareOutputs`.

### Outputs

You may only output files in the current package, but anywhere in the current
package is allowed.

You are not allowed to overwrite existing files, only create new ones.

Outputs from previous builds will not be treated as inputs to later ones.

### Source control

This package creates a top level `.dart_tool` folder in your package, which
should not be submitted to your source control repo (likely this just means
adding '.dart_tool' to your '.gitignore' file).

When it comes to generated files it is generally best to not submit them to
source control, but a specific `Builder` may provide a recommendation otherwise.

It should be noted that if you do submit generated files to your repo then when
you change branches or merge in changes you may get a warning on your next build
about declared outputs that already exist. This will be followed up with a
prompt to delete those files. You can type `l` to list the files, and then type
`y` to delete them if everything looks correct. If you think something is wrong
you can type `n` to abandon the build without taking any action.

### Publishing packages

In general generated files should be published with your package, but this may
not always be the case. Some `Builder`s may provide a recommendation for this as
well.

## Implementing your own Builders

If you have written a pub `Transformer` in the past, then the `Builder`api
should be familiar to you. The main difference is that `Builders` must always
declare their outputs, similar to a `DeclaringTransformer`.

The basic api looks like this:

```dart
abstract class Builder {
  /// You can only output files in `build` that you declare here. You are not
  /// required to output all of these files, but no other [Builder] is allowed
  /// to declare the same outputs.
  List<AssetId> declareOutputs(AssetId input);

  /// Similar to `Transformer.apply`. This is where you build and output files.
  Future build(BuildStep buildStep);
}
```

Building on the example in [Running Builds](#running-builds), here is an
implementation of a `Builder` which just copies files to other files with the
same name, but an additional extension:

```dart
/// A really simple [Builder], it just makes copies!
class CopyBuilder implements Builder {
  final String extension;

  CopyBuilder(this.extension)

  Future build(BuildStep buildStep) async {
    /// Each [buildStep] has just one input. This is a fully realized [Asset]
    /// with its [stringContents] already available.
    var input = buildStep.input;

    /// Create a new [Asset], with the new [AssetId].
    var copy = new Asset(_copiedId(input.id), input.stringContents);

    /// Write out the [Asset].
    ///
    /// There is no need to `await` here, the system handles waiting on these
    /// files as necessary before advancing to the next phase.
    buildStep.writeAsString(copy);
  }

  /// Declare your outputs, just one file in this case.
  List<AssetId> declareOutputs(AssetId inputId) => [_copiedId(inputId)];

  AssetId _copiedId(AssetId inputId) => inputId.addExtension('$extension');
}
```

It should be noted that you should _never_ touch the file system directly. Go
through the `buildStep#readAsString` and `buildStep#writeAsString` methods in
order to read and write assets. This is what enables the package to track all of
your dependencies and do incremental rebuilds. It is also what enables your
`Builder` to run on different environments.

### Using the analyzer (**experimental**)

If you need to do analyzer resolution, you can use the `BuildStep#resolve`
method. This makes sure that all `Builder`s in the system share the same
analysis context, which greatly speeds up the overall system when multiple
`Builder`s are doing resolution. Additionally, it handles for you making the
analyzer work in an async environment.

This `Resolver` has the exact same api as the one from `code_transformers`, so
migrating to it should be easy if you have used `code_transformers` in the past.

Here is an example of a `Builder` which uses the `resolve` method:

```dart
class ResolvingCopyBuilder {
  Future build(BuildStep buildStep) {
    /// Resolves all libraries reachable from the primary input.
    var resolver = await buildStep.resolve(buildStep.input.id);
    /// Get a [LibraryElement] by asset id.
    var entryLib = resolver.getLibrary(buildStep.input.id);
    /// Or get a [LibraryElement] by name.
    var otherLib = resolver.getLibraryByName('my.library');

    /// **IMPORTANT**: If you don't release a resolver, your builds will hang.
    resolver.release();
  }

  /// Declare outputs as well....
}
```

Once you have gotten a `LibraryElement` using one of the methods on `Resolver`,
you are now just using the regular `analyzer` package to explore your app.

**Important Note**: As shown in the code above, you _must_ call `release` on
your resolver when you are done. If you don't then the next call to `resolve`
will never complete.
