## 1.0.3

- Fixes a bug where transitive `dart-ext:` imports would cause the resolver
  to fail. These uris will now be ignored.

## 1.0.2

- Ensure that `BuildAssetUriResolver.restoreAbsolute` never returns null.
  - Fixes a crash when a resolver is requested but not all transitive sources
    are available yet.

## 1.0.1

- Fix a bug causing crashes on windows.

## 1.0.0

- Migrate to `AnalysisDriver`. There are behavior changes which may be breaking.
  The `LibraryElement` instances returned by the resolver will now:
  - Have non-working `context` fields.
  - Have no source offsets for annotations or their errors.
  - Have working `session` fields.
  - Have `Source` instances with different URIs than before.
  - Not include missing libraries in the `importedLibraries` getter. You can
    instead use the `imports` getter to see all the imports.

## 0.2.3

- Update to `build` `1.1.0` and add `assetIdForElement`.

## 0.2.2+7

- Updated _AssetUriResolver to prepare for a future release of the analyzer.
- Increased the upper bound for `package:analyzer` to `<0.35.0`.

## 0.2.2+6

## 0.2.2+5

- Increased the upper bound for the `build` to `<1.1.0`.

## 0.2.2+4

- Removed dependency on cli_util.
- Increased the upper bound for the `build` to `<0.12.9`.

## 0.2.2+3

- Don't log a severe message when a URI cannot be resolved. Just return `null`.

## 0.2.2+2

  resolver faster (reapplied).
