# build_web_compilers is not currently part of the workspace because it
# requires a very recent version of the Dart SDK. mono_repo generates a CI
# definition that runs each package with the lowest SDK version it supports.
# This breaks `dart pub get` in the entire workspace, so it (and `_test` which
# needs to use all packages from the repository) can't be part of the
# workspace.
