# `build`

Defines the basic pieces of how a build happens and how they interact.

## [`Builder`][dartdoc:Builder]

The business logic for code generation. Most consumers of the `build` package
will create custom implementations of `Builder`.

## [`BuildStep`][dartdoc:BuildStep]

The way a `Builder` interacts with the outside world. Defines the unit of work
and allows reading/writing files and resolving Dart source code.

## [`Resolver`][dartdoc:Resolver] class

An interface into the dart [analyzer][pub:analyzer] to allow resolution of code
that needs static analysis and/or code generation.

## Differences between the `build` package and `pub`.

You might be asking, why use this package instead of a pub `Transformer`? There
are a few key differences that make this package better for most use cases.

Also see https://github.com/dart-lang/build/wiki/Writing-a-Builder.

### Outputs

Pub will only ever output files into your `build` directory, and pub serve only
ever outputs them into an in-memory file system. With the `build` package, you
can output files anywhere in the current package.

This enables you to generate dart files which are imported by your project,
without getting any warnings about missing files from the analyzer. At the same
time it enables you to easily go explore those files in your editor, and set
breakpoints inside those files.

### Consistency

You can't overwrite any pre-existing files using `build`, you can only generate
new ones.

In pub a transformer could overwrite a file any number of times, and this can
lead to confusion and difficulty when debugging, especially with source maps.

### Incremental builds

The `build` package requires Builders to configure which output file extensions
will be built for corresponding input file extensions. This allows fine grained
and incremental builds. See the `build_runner` package for an approach to
incremental builds.

With `pub`, some transformations on your package dependencies may be cached, but
any transformations on your current package are always redone each time you call
`pub build` or `pub serve`. In serve mode it will do incremental builds once the
first build has run, but if you restart it then you have to start over from
scratch.

### Execution modes and reflection

Most frameworks that use reflection today enable running in two different modes,
one which uses `dart:mirrors` for development in dartium, and one which uses
static code generated by a `Transformer` for deployment. All features that use
reflection have to be implemented in both modes, and bugs might exist in only
one mode. This all ends up resulting in obscure deployment time only issues,
as well as a lot of wasted cycles testing the same app in multiple different
modes.

With `build`, you can eliminate entirely the `dart:mirrors` mode. You are always
using the generated code, all the time. This makes it easier on framework devs,
and easier on users who have fewer modes to support.

## Implementing your own Builders

If you have written a pub `Transformer` in the past, then the
[`Builder`][dartdoc:Builder] API should be familiar to you. The main difference
is that `Builders` must always configure outputs based on input extensions.

The basic API looks like this:

```dart
abstract class Builder {
  /// You can only output files in `build` that are configured here. You are not
  /// required to output all of these files, but no other [Builder] is allowed
  /// to produce the same outputs.
  Map<String, List<String>> get buildExtensions;

  /// Similar to `Transformer.apply`. This is where you build and output files.
  Future build(BuildStep buildStep);
}
```

Here is an implementation of a `Builder` which just copies files to other files
with the same name, but an additional extension:

```dart
/// A really simple [Builder], it just makes copies!
class CopyBuilder implements Builder {
  final String extension;

  CopyBuilder(this.extension)

  Future build(BuildStep buildStep) async {
    /// Each [buildStep] has a single input.
    var input = buildStep.inputId;

    /// Create a new target [AssetId] based on the old one.
    var copy = inputId.addExtension(extension);
    var contents = await buildStep.readAsString(input);

    /// Write out the new asset.
    ///
    /// There is no need to `await` here, the system handles waiting on these
    /// files as necessary before advancing to the next phase.
    buildStep.writeAsString(copy, contents);
  }

  /// Configure output extensions. All possible inputs match the empty input
  /// extension. For each input 1 output is created with `extension` appended to
  /// the path.
  Map<String, List<String>> get buildExtensions =>  {'': [extension]};
}
```

It should be noted that you should _never_ touch the file system directly. Go
through the `buildStep#readAsString` and `buildStep#writeAsString` methods in
order to read and write assets. This is what enables the package to track all of
your dependencies and do incremental rebuilds. It is also what enables your
[`Builder`][dartdoc:Builder] to run on different environments.

### Using the analyzer

If you need to do analyzer resolution, you can use the `BuildStep#resolver`
object. This makes sure that all `Builder`s in the system share the same
analysis context, which greatly speeds up the overall system when multiple
`Builder`s are doing resolution.

Here is an example of a `Builder` which uses the `resolve` method:

```dart
class ResolvingCopyBuilder {
  Future build(BuildStep buildStep) async {
    // Get the [LibraryElement] for the primary input.
    var entryLib = buildStep.inputLibrary;
    // Resolves all libraries reachable from the primary input.
    var resolver = await buildStep.resolver;
    // Get a [LibraryElement] for another asset.
    var otherLib = resolver.getLibrary(new AssetId.resolve('some_import.dart'),
        from: buildStep.inputId);
    // Or get a [LibraryElement] by name.
    var otherLib = resolver.getLibraryByName('my.library');
  }

  /// Configure outputs as well....
}
```

Once you have gotten a `LibraryElement` using one of the methods on `Resolver`,
you are now just using the regular `analyzer` package to explore your app.

### Sharing expensive objects across build steps

The build package includes a `Resource` class, which can give you an instance
of an expensive object that is guaranteed to be unique across builds, but may
be re-used by multiple build steps within a single build (to the extent that
the implementation allows). It also gives you a way of disposing of your
resource at the end of its lifecycle.

The `Resource<T>` constructor takes a single required argument which is a
factory function that returns a `FutureOr<T>`. There is also a named argument
`dispose` which is called at the end of life for the resource, with the
instance that should be disposed. This returns a `FutureOr<dynamic>`.

So a simple example `Resource` would look like this:

```dart
final resource = new Resource(
  () => createMyExpensiveResource(),
  dispose: (instance) async {
    await instance.doSomeCleanup();
  });
```

You can get an instance of the underlying resource by using the
`BuildStep#fetchResource` method, whose type signature looks like
`Future<T> fetchResource<T>(Resource<T>)`.

**Important Note**: It may be tempting to try and use a `Resource` instance to
cache information from previous build steps (or even assets), but this should
be avoided because it can break the soundness of the build, and may introduce
subtle bugs for incremental builds (remember the whole build doesn't run every
time!). The `build` package relies on the `BuildStep#canRead` and
`BuildStep#readAs*` methods to track build step dependencies, so sidestepping
those can and will break the dependency tracking, resulting in inconsistent and
stale assets.
