/// A handle to create and cleanup some expensive object based on a lifecycle
/// defined by the build system.
///
/// It is unsafe to read or write global state during a build. The build system
/// may run incompatible builds where previously written global state is
/// invalid. [Resource] bridges the gap and allows a pattern for communicating
/// "global" level information during a build, with hooks to maintain isolation
/// between separate builds.
///
/// Reuse is based on the [Resource] identity. To allow for sharing within a
/// build, each value should be fetched with the same instance. Commonly the
/// [Resource] is a global variable. The values of type [T] should not be reused
/// or shared outside of the reuse provided by the build system through
/// `BuildStep.fetchResource`.
///
/// If a `dispose` callback is available it will be called between builds and it
/// should clean up any state that may not be valid on a subsequent build. If no
/// `dispose` callback is passed the value will be discarded between builds.
/// Only "universal" state should be retained by the instance after `dispose`.
/// Any state which is particular to a single build should be cleared or marked
/// dirty during dispose, and validated before subsequent use. For instance,
/// within a given build no asset content will change, however on subsequent
/// builds assets may have difference content. Asset digests may be useful for
/// validating caches that can be reused between builds.
///
/// If a `beforeExit` callback is available it will be called before a clean
/// exit of the build system for any resources fetched during any build.
///
/// The [Resource] lifecycle helps with the problem of leaking state across
/// separate builds, but it does not help with the problem of leaking state
/// during a single build. For consistent output and correct rerunning of
/// builders, the build system needs to track all of the inputs - any
/// information that is read - for a given build step.
///
/// Most resources should accept a `BuildStep`, or an `AssetReader` argument
/// and ensure that any assets which contribute to the result have an
/// interaction for each builder which uses that result. For example if a
/// resource is caching the result of an expensive computation on some asset, it
/// might read the asset and perform some work the first time it is used, and
/// call only `AssetReader.canRead` to verify the caller is allowed to access
/// the information before returning the cached result on subsequent calls.
///
/// Build system implementations should be the only users that directly
/// instantiate a [ResourceManager] since they can handle the lifecycle
/// guarantees in a sane way.
///

///     // Any information returned to the caller should be derived from content
