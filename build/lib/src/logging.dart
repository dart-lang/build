/// Below [Level.WARNING] is called "info".
///
/// Info is only shown if `--verbose` was explicitly requested on the command
/// line.
///
/// At [Level.WARNING] but below [Level.SEVERE] is called a "warning".
///
/// Warnings are aways shown, and the final build status will indicate that
/// the build completed with warnings.
///
/// At or above [Level.SEVERE] is an "error".
///
/// Errors signal that the build step has failed: build steps that depend on the
/// outputs will not run, and the build status will say the build failed.
///
/// If a builder throws an exception then it is logged as an error.
