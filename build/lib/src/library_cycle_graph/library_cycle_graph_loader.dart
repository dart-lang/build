/// Loads [LibraryCycleGraph]s during a phased build.
///
/// "Phased build" means:
///
///  - The build has a "timeline" described by an `int` phase number
///  - Build actions can see output from earlier phases but not from the
///   current phase or later phases
///  - Build phases do _not_ run monotonically, but are interleaved; an action
///    in phase x might trigger an action in phase y, where y < x
///
/// And these further details apply to `build_runner` builds:
///
///  - Action outputs are predictable: for any file that might be produced, it
///    is known before the build starts what build action might produce it, and
///    in what phase
///
/// This complicates dependency tracking in two notable ways.
///
/// Firstly, it means that the transitive dependencies of a node can change: if
/// any dependency is a generated source, then at the phase _after_ the one in
/// which it's generated, it must be parsed and any direct and indirect
/// dependencies added.
///
/// Secondly, because the loader is for use _during_ the build, it might be that
/// not all files have been generated yet. So, results must be returned based on
/// incomplete data, as needed.
///
/// There can be multiple concurrent computations running on top of the same
/// state, as noted in the implementation. It is allowed to call the methods
/// `libraryCycleOf`, `libraryCycleGraphOf` and `transitiveDepsOf` while a prior
/// call to any of the methods is still running, provided each newer call is at
/// an earlier phase. This happens when a load does a read that triggers a build
/// of a generated file in an earlier phase.
