# Getting started with `build_runner`

To use `build_runner`, you need a 2.x (dev channel or fresher) version of
the Dart SDK.

## Using `build_runner` as a development server

1. Edit your package's **pubspec.yaml** file,
   adding dev dependencies on **build_runner** and **build_web_compilers**:

   ```yaml
   ...
   environment:
     sdk: '>=2.0.0-dev <2.0.0'
   ...
   dev_dependencies:
     build_runner: ^0.7.0
     build_web_compilers: ^0.2.0
   ```

2. Get package dependencies:

   ```sh
   pub get
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```sh
   pub run build_runner serve
   ```

While the `serve` command runs, every change you save triggers a rebuild.

The first build is the slowest. After that, assets are cached on disk and
incremental builds are faster.

## Creating an output directory

Build with `--output <directory name>` to write files into a merged output
directory with file paths that match internally referenced URIs. This can be
used with the `build`, `watch`, and `serve` commands. This directory can also
used with a different server if the `serve` command is insufficient.

To output only part of the package, for example to output only the `web`
directory, use `--output web:<directory name>`.

## Using other `build_runner` commands

In addition to **serve** you can use:

- **build:** Runs a single build and exits. This is most useful if your build
  also generates output to your source directory. With `--output <dirname>` this
  also creates a merged output directory with all sources and generated assets.

- **watch:** Like `build` but reruns after file changes. With
  `--output <dirname>` the merged output directory will be kept up to date with
  changes. This can be used to keep the outputs updated for use with another
  filed-based development server.

- **test:** Creates an output directory and runs `pub run test` within it.
  This command requires a dev dependency on `build_test`.

## Switching to dart2js

By default `build_web_compilers` uses dartdevc. To switch to dart2js, pass
`--release` to `pub run build_runner build` (or `serve`). Pass args to dart2js
by creating a `build.yaml` file.

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      build_web_compilers|entrypoint:
        options:
          dart2js_args:
          - --minify
          - --fast-startup
```

## Compatibility with other packages

### Upgrading from transformers

`build_runner` can only run Builders that are published with a `build.yaml`
file; it can't use legacy `Transformers`. If your pubspec lists transformers,
switch to a version of the transformer-containing package that has a
`build.yaml` file.

### Upgrading from manual `build.dart` files

Older versions of `build_runner` were designed to run with manually written
build scripts referencing the Builders available in the local package or in
dependencies. This pattern can still be used when customization is needed
outside of `build.yaml`, but we recommend using the generated build script
with `pub run build_runner`, because it will be kept up to date with changes
in the build packages. If your pubspec lists transformers, switch to a version of
the builder-containing package that has a `build.yaml` file.

## Replacing `dart_to_js_script_rewriter`

When the development process included `dartium` HTML files typically referenced
`main.dart` and used a transformer to rewrite to `main.dart.js` for deployment.
The new development process uses DDC and so always compiles to javascript. Any
script tags should be manually rewritten to always reference `*.dart.js` with a
`type` of `application/javascript` rather than `application/dart`.
`dart_to_js_script_rewriter` and `browser` dependencies can be dropped.


## Troubleshooting

<!-- summarize here. -->

### Diagnosing build times

See
<https://github.com/dart-lang/build/blob/master/docs/measuring_performance.md>.

### build_runner has no versions that match...

1. Make sure you're using a 2.x SDK.

   ```sh
   dart --version
   ```

2. Check the versions of the packages that your app depends on.
   They should all be compatible with a 2.x SDK.


### Too many open files

If you see a FileSystemException, saying the directory listing failed
due to too many open files, you might need to increase the OS limits.

For details, see <https://github.com/dart-lang/build/issues/857>.
