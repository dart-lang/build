The `build_runner` package provides a concrete way of generating files using
Dart code, outside of tools like `pub`. Unlike `pub serve/build`, files are
always generated directly on disk, and rebuilds are _incremental_ - inspired by
tools such as [Bazel][].

## Installation

This package is intended to support development of Dart projects with
[`package:build`][]. In general, put it under [dev_dependencies][], in your
[`pubspec.yaml`][pubspec].

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  build_runner:
```

## Usage

When the packages providing `Builder`s are configured with a `build.yaml` file
they are designed to be consumed using an generated build script. Most builders
should need little or no configuration, see the documentation provided with the
Builder to decide whether the build needs to be customized. If it does you may
also provide a `build.yaml` with the configuration. See the
`package:build_config` README for more information on this file.

To have web code compiled to js add a `dev_dependency` on `build_web_compilers`.

### Built-in Commands

The `build_runner` package exposes a binary by the same name, which can be
invoked using `pub run build_runner <command>`.

The available commands are `build`, `watch`, `serve`, and `test`.

- `build`: Runs a single build and exits.
- `watch`: Runs a persistent build server that watches the files system for
  edits and does rebuilds as necessary.
- `serve`: Same as `watch`, but runs a development server as well.
  - By default this serves the `web` and `test` directories, on port `8080` and
    `8081` respectively. See below for how to configure this.
- `test`: Runs a single build, creates a merged output directory, and then runs
  `pub run test --precompiled <merged-output-dir>`. See below for instructions
  on passing custom args to the test command.

#### Command Line Options

All the above commands support the following arguments:

- `--help`: Print usage information for the command.
- `--assume-tty`: Enables colors and interactive input when the script does not
  appear to be running directly in a terminal, for instance when it is a
  subprocess.
- `--delete-conflicting-outputs`: Assume conflicting outputs in the users
  package are from previous builds, and skip the user prompt that would usually
  be provided.
- `--[no-]fail-on-severe`: Whether to consider the build a failure on an error
  logged. By default this is false.

Some commands also have additional options:

##### serve

- `--hostname`: The host to run the server on.
- `--live-reload`: Enables automatic page reloading on rebuilds.
  Can't be used together with `--hot-reload`.
- `--hot-reload`: Enables automatic reloading of changed modules on rebuilds.
  See [hot-module-reloading](../docs/hot_module_reloading.md) for more info.
  Can't be used together with `--live-reload`.

Trailing args of the form `<directory>:<port>` are supported to customize what
directories are served, and on what ports.

For example to serve the `example` and `web` directories on ports 8000 and 8001
you would do `pub run build_runner serve example:8000 web:8001`.

##### test

The test command will forward any arguments after an empty `--` arg to the
`pub run test` command.

For example if you wanted to pass `-p chrome` you would do
`pub run build_runner test -- -p chrome`.

### Inputs

Valid inputs follow the general dart package rules. You can read any files under
the top level `lib` folder any package dependency, and you can read all files
from the current package.

In general it is best to be as specific as possible with your `InputSet`s,
because all matching files will be checked against a `Builder`'s
[`buildExtensions`][build_extensions] - see [outputs](#outputs) for more
information.

### Outputs

* You may output files anywhere in the current package.

> **NOTE**: When a `BuilderApplication` specifies `hideOutput: true` it may
> output under the `lib` folder of _any_ package you depend on.

* Builders are not allowed to overwrite existing files, only create new ones.
* Outputs from previous builds will not be treated as inputs to later ones.
* You may use a previous `BuilderApplications`'s outputs as an input to a later
  action.

### Source control

This package creates a top level `.dart_tool` folder in your package, which
should not be submitted to your source control repository. You can see [our own
`.gitignore`](https://github.com/dart-lang/build/blob/master/.gitignore) as an
example.

```git
# Files generated by dart tools
.dart_tool
```

When it comes to _generated_ files it is generally best to not submit them to
source control, but a specific `Builder` may provide a recommendation otherwise.

It should be noted that if you do submit generated files to your repo then when
you change branches or merge in changes you may get a warning on your next build
about declared outputs that already exist. This will be followed up with a
prompt to delete those files. You can type `l` to list the files, and then type
`y` to delete them if everything looks correct. If you think something is wrong
you can type `n` to abandon the build without taking any action.

### Publishing packages

In general generated files **should** be published with your package, but this
may not always be the case. Some `Builder`s may provide a recommendation for
this as well.


## Legacy Usage

If the generated script does not do everything you need it's possible to
manually write one. With this approach every package which *uses* a
[`Builder`][builder] must have it's own script, they cannot be reused
from other packages. A package which defines a [`Builder`][builder] may have an
example you can reference, but a unique script must be written for the consuming
packages as well. You can reference the generated script at
`.dart_tool/build/entrypoint/build.dart` for an example.

Your script should use one of the following functions defined by this library:

- [**`run`**][run_fn]: Use the same argument parsing as the generated approach.
- [**`build`**][build_fn]: Run a single build and exit.
- [**`watch`**][watch_fn]: Continuously run builds as you edit files.

### Configuring

[`run`][run_fn], [`build`][build_fn], and [`watch`][watch_fn] have a required
argument which is a `List<BuilderApplication>`. These correspond to the
`BuilderDefinition` class from `package:build_config`. See `apply` and
`applyToRoot` to create instances of this class. These will be translated into
actions by crawling through dependencies. The order of this list is important.
Each Builder may read the generated outputs of any Builder that ran on a package
earlier in the dependency graph, but for the package it is running on it may
only read the generated outputs from Builders earlier in the list of
`BuilderApplication`s.

**NOTE**: Any time you change your build script (or any of its dependencies),
the next build will be a full rebuild. This is because the system has no way
of knowing how that change may have affected the outputs.

## Contributing

We welcome a diverse set of contributions, including, but not limited to:

* [Filing bugs and feature requests][file_an_issue]
* [Send a pull request][pull_request]
* Or, create something awesome using this API and share with us and others!

For the stability of the API and existing users, consider opening an issue
first before implementing a large new feature or breaking an API. For smaller
changes (like documentation, minor bug fixes), just send a pull request.

### Testing

All pull requests are validated against [travis][travis], and must pass. The
`build_runner` package lives in a mono repository with other `build` packages,
and _all_ of the following checks must pass for _each_ package.

Ensure code passes all our [analyzer checks][analysis_options]:

```sh
$ dartanalyzer .
```

Ensure all code is formatted with the latest [dev-channel SDK][dev_sdk].

```sh
$ dartfmt -w .
```

Run all of our unit tests:

```sh
$ pub run test
```
