## 0.4.4-dev

- Change the default dart2js arguments in release mode from `--minify` to `-O2`.
  This is a new argument, which applies all "safe" optimizations.

## 0.4.3

- Only call `window.postMessage` during initialization if the current context
  is a `Window`.
- Fixed an error while showing stack traces for DDC generated scripts
  when `<base>` tag is used.
- Value of `<base href="/.../">` tag should start and end with a `/` to be
  used as the base url for require js.
- Added more javascript code to dev bootstrap for hot-reloading support
- Support the latest build_modules.

## 0.4.2+2

- Add magic comment marker for build_runner to know where to inject
  live-reloading client code. This is only present when using the `dartdevc`
  compiler. (reapplied)

## 0.4.2+1

- Restore `new` keyword for a working release on Dart 1 VM.

## 0.4.2

- Add magic comment marker for build_runner to know where to inject
  live-reloading client code. This is only present when using the `dartdevc`
  compiler.
- Release broken on Dart 1 VM.

## 0.4.1

- Support the latest build_modules, with updated dart2js support so that it can
  do multiple builds concurrently and will restart workers periodically to
  mitigate the effects of dart-lang/sdk#33708.
- Improvements to reduce the memory usage of the dart2js builder, so that
  transitive dependency information can be garbage collected before the dart2js
  compile is completed.
- Increased the upper bound for the sdk to `<3.0.0`.

## 0.4.0+5

- Fixed an issue where subdirectories with hyphens in the name weren't
  bootstrapped properly in dartdevc.

## 0.4.0+4

- Expand support for `package:build_config` to include version `0.3.x`.

## 0.4.0+3

- Expand support for `package:archive` to include version `2.x.x`.

## 0.4.0+2

- Fix a dart2 error.

## 0.4.0+1

- Support `package:analyzer` `0.32.0`.

## 0.4.0

- Changed the default for `enable_sync_async` to `true` for the
  `build_web_compilers|entrypoint` builder.
- Changed the default for `ignore_cast_failures` to `false` for the
  `build_web_compilers|entrypoint` builder.

## 0.3.8

- Remove `.dart` sources and `.js.map` files from the output directory in
  release mode.
- Clean up `.tar.gz` outputs produced by `Dart2Js.`
- Don't output extra `Dart2Js` outputs other than deferred part files.
- Fixed a logical error in `dartdevc` compiler to detect correct base url for
  require js.
- Added a `enable_sync_async` option to the `build_web_compilers|entrypoint`
  builder, which defaults to `false`.

## 0.3.7+3

- The `dartdevc` compiler now respects the `<base href="/....">` tags and will
  set them as the base url for require js.

## 0.3.7+2

- Fix sdk stack trace folding in the browser console and package:test.

## 0.3.7+1

- Add missing dependency on the `pool` package.

## 0.3.7

- Reduce memory usage by requesting (and lazily building) lower level modules
  first when building for an entrypoint.

## 0.3.6

- Add support for compiling with `dart2js` by default in release mode.

## 0.3.5

- Don't ignore cast failures by default. We expect most code to be clean with
  cast failures, and the option can be manually enabled with config.

## 0.3.4+2

- Create `.packages` file and use the new frontend with `dart2js`.

## 0.3.4+1

- Use `--use-old-frontend` with `dart2js` as a stopgap until we can add support
  for `.packages` files.

## 0.3.4

- Added support for dart2js deferred loading.
- Added support for bootstrapping code in web workers with `dartdevc`.

## 0.3.3

- Added support for `--dump-info` and the `dart2js` compiler. If you pass that
  argument with `dart2js_args` the `.info.json` file will be copied the output.

## 0.3.2

- Dart2JS now has minification (`--minify`) enabled by default, similar to how
  it worked in `pub build`. If you are adding custom `dart2js` options, make
  sure you still keep the `--minify` flag. Here is an example:

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      build_web_compilers|entrypoint:
        generate_for:
        - web/**.dart
        options:
          compiler: dart2js
          dart2js_args:
          - --fast-startup
          - --minify
          - --trust-type-annotations
          - --trust-primitives
```

## 0.3.1

- Cast failures will now be ignored in dartdevc by default (these were enabled
  in the latest sdk), and added an `ignore_cast_failures` option to the
  `build_web_compilers|entrypoint` builder which you can set to `true` to enable
  them.
  - At some point in the future it is expected that the default for this will
    flip.

## 0.3.0+1

- Fixed an issue with `dart2js` and the `--no-source-maps` flag.

## 0.3.0

### Breaking changes

- Split `ModuleBuilder`, `UnlinkedSummaryBuilder` and `LinkedSummaryBuilder`
  into a separate `build_modules` package.

## 0.2.1+1

- Support the latest `analyzer` package.

## 0.2.1

- All dart files under `test` are now compiled by default instead of only the
  `_browser_test.dart` files (minus vm/node test bootstrap files). This means
  the original tests can be debugged directly (prior to package:test
  bootstrapping).
- Updated to `package:build` version `0.12.0`.

## 0.2.0

### New Features

- Added support for `dart2js`. This can be configured using the top level
  `compiler` option for the `build_web_compilers|entrypoint` builder. The
  supported options are `dartdevc` (the default) and `dart2js`. Args can be
  passed to `dart2js` using the `dart2js_args` option. For example:

```yaml
targets:
  <my_package>:
    builders:
      build_web_compilers|entrypoint:
        options:
          compiler: dart2js
          dart2js_args:
          - --minify
```

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed `ddc_bootstrap` builder to `entrypoint`, the exposed class also
  changed from `DevCompilerBootstrapBuilder` to `WebEntrypointBuilder`.
- Renamed `jsBootstrapExtension` to `ddcBootstrapExtension` since it is only
  required when using the dev compiler.

## 0.1.1

- Mark `ddc_bootstrap` builder with `build_to: cache`.
- Publish as `build_web_compilers`

## 0.1.0

- Add builder factories.
- Fixed temp dir cleanup bug on windows.
- Enabled support for running tests in --precompiled mode.

## 0.0.1

- Initial release with support for building analyzer summaries and DDC modules.
