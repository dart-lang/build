## 2.14.0

- Strip stratch directory paths from a new metadata field `fullKernelUri`

## 2.13.0

- Add `native_null_asserts` boolean option to the
  `build_web_compilers:entrypoint` builder. This is disabled by default but
  will be enabled by default in a later release. 

## 2.12.3

- Fix handling of explicit `sound_null_safety` option for `dart2js` compiles.

## 2.12.2

- Fix parsing of `environment` config for DDC when using a bool or numeric
  value.
- Add `sound_null_safety` and `null_assertions` boolean options to the
  `build_web_compilers|entrypoint` builder.

## 2.12.1

- Require `build_modules` version `^3.0.0`.

## 2.12.0

- Support sound null safety in ddc/dart2js, based on the standard entrypoint
  detection (enable null safety if the entrypoint opts in).
- Update dart2js support to enable experiments if provided, and use a
  multi-root scheme for non-package uris.
- Require `build` version `>=1.5.0`.

## 2.12.0-dev.3

- Fix stripping scratch paths in metadata.

## 2.12.0-dev.2

- Add the `generate-full-dill` option for the `build_web_compilers:ddc`
  builder. The full dill output is used by expression evaluation service
  in webdev for expression evaluation feature. This setting is disabled by
  default but can be enabled by setting it to `true` globally:

```yaml
global_options:
  build_web_compilers:ddc:
    options:
      generate-full-dill: true
```

## 2.12.0-dev.1

- Update `build_web_compilers|ddc` builder to produce a `.metadata` file.
- Update `build_web_compilers|entrypoint` builder to produce a
  `.ddc_merged_metadata` file which consists of new line separated
  `.metadata` content produced by DDC.
- Migrate off of deprecated analyzer apis.
- Allow the latest analyzer version `0.40.x`.

## 2.11.0

- Deprecated support for the `experiments` configuration in favor of the
  general mechanism exposed by the build package(exposed through the
  `--enable-experiment` flag to match other Dart tools).

## 2.10.0

- Pass the package_config.json file when compiling with ddc/dart2js instead of
  the .packages file.

## 2.9.0

- Add support for enabling experiments through the `experiments` option on the
  `build_web_compilers|ddc` builder. This must be configured globally.
  - This is a list of experiment names, which translates into
    `--enable-experiment=<name>` arguments.

## 2.8.0

- Enable asserts in dev mode with dart2js by default.

## 2.7.2

- Fix a bug with hot restart,
  [#2586](https://github.com/dart-lang/build/issues/2586).

## 2.7.1

- Allow analyzer version `0.39.x`.

## 2.7.0

- Added an `environment` option to the `DevCompilerBuilder`.
  - This can be configured using the `environment` option of the
    `build_web_compilers|ddc` builder.
  - The expected value is a `Map<String, String>` and is equivalent to
    providing `-D<key>=<value>` command line arguments.
  - This option should only be set globally, and will throw if it ever recieves
    two different values. This is to ensure all modules are compiled with the
    same environment.

## 2.6.4

- Deobfuscate DDC extension method stack traces.

## 2.6.3

- Enforce builder application ordering between the SDK JS copy builder and the
  DDC entrypoint builder.

## 2.6.2

Fix the skipPlatformCheck option which was accidentally doing the opposite
of what it claimed.

## 2.6.1

- Use the kernel version of `dart_sdk.js` rather than the analyzer version.

## 2.6.0

Add an option to globally skip the platform checks instead of only skipping
them for a set of whitelisted packages.

## 2.5.2

Republish of `2.5.0` with the proper min sdk contraint.

## 2.5.1

### Bug fix for issue #2464

Ignore the `trackUnusedInputs` option that was added in `2.5.0`.

This option will be respected again in the next release which will have the
proper minimum sdk constraint.

## 2.5.0

Add support for dependency pruning to the `DevCompilerBuilder`. This should
greatly improve the invalidation semantics for builds, meaning that less code
will be recompiled for each edit you make.

This is enabled by default when using build_runner, and can be disabled using
the `track-unused-inputs: false` option if you run into issues, so in your
`build.yaml` it would look like this:

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    build_web_compilers:ddc:
      options:
        track-unused-inputs: false
```

When using the builder programatically it is disabled by default and can be
enabled by passing `trackUnusedInputs: true` to the `DevCompilerBuilder`
constructor.

## 2.4.1

Make the required assets for DDC applications configurable in the
`bootstrapDdc` method instead of hard coded. This allows custom integrations
like flutter web to not require the same assets, or require additional custom
assets.

## 2.4.0

### New Feature: Better --build-filter support for building a single test.

You can now build a basic app or test in isolation by only requesting the
`*.dart.js` file using a build filter, for example adding this argument to any
build_runner command would build the `web/main.dart` app only:
`--build-filter=web/main.dart.js`.

For tests you will need to specify the bootstrapped test file, so:
`--build-filter=test/hello_world.dart.browser_test.dart.js`.

Previously you also had to explicitly require the SDK resources like:
`--build-filter="package:build_web_compilers/**.js"` or similar.

**Note**: If your app relies on any non-Dart generated files you will likely
have to ask for those explicitly as well with additinal filters.

## 2.3.0

- Add an option to the DDC bootstrap to skip the checks around modules that have
  imports to unsupported SDK libraries like `dart:io` when the module is from a
  specified package. This is not used in the default build, but is available for
  custom DDC integrations.

## 2.2.3

- Allow analyzer version 0.38.0.

## 2.2.2

- Re-publish 2.2.0 with proper minimum sdk constraint of >=2.4.0.

## 2.2.1

- Revert of bad 2.2.0 release (had a bad min sdk).

## 2.2.0

- Make `librariesPath` configurable in `DevCompilerBuilder`.

## 2.1.5

- Add pre-emptive support for an upcoming breaking change in ddc
  around entrypoint naming.

## 2.1.4

- Allow analyzer version 0.37.0.

## 2.1.3

- Improve error message when `dart2js_args` is configured improperly.

## 2.1.2

- Fix hot restart bootstrapping logic for dart scripts that live in a
  different directory than the html file.

## 2.1.1

- Prepare for source map change from dartdevc, don't modify relative paths in
  source maps.
- Fix hot reload bootstrap logic for app entrypoints under lib.

## 2.1.0

- Make `platformSdk`, `sdkKernelPath`, and `platform` configurable in
  `DevCompilerBuilder`.

## 2.0.2

- Prepare for the next sdk release, which changes what the uris look like for
  non-package sources, and breaks our existing hot restart logic.

## 2.0.1

- Fix issue #2269, which could cause applications to fail to properly bootstrap.
- Skip compiling modules with ddc when the primary source isn't the primary
  input (only shows up in non-lazy builds - essentially just tests).

## 2.0.0

### Major Update - Switch to use the common front end.

In this release, the Dart front end for the `dev_compiler` is changing from the
[analyzer] to the common [front end][front_end]. This should unify error
messages and general consistency across platforms, as this was one of the last
compilers left still using the analyzer as a front end.

While this is intended to be a transparent change, it is likely that there will
be unintended differences. Please [file issues][issue tracker] if you experience
something that seems broken or not working as intended.

### Major Update - Auto-detection of web support for applications

Previously, all files with a `main` that were matched by the input globs would
attempt to compile for the web. This caused an issue when there were non-web
applications in the default directories, which specifically happens a lot in the
`test` directory. Resolving this required custom globs in `build.yaml` files.

Two changes were made to help handle this issue more gracefully, in a way that
often doesn't require custom `build.yaml` files any more.

- Before compiling any app, build_web_compilers will check that all its
  transitive modules are compatible with the web (based on their `dart:`
  imports).
  - Today we will log a warning message for any app that isn't compatible, as
    ultimately it is most efficient to exclude these using globs in your
    `build.yaml` than waiting for us to detect it. This may change based on
    feedback.
- Changed the default glob for the `test` directory to only include the
  `test/**.dart.browser_test.dart` files (other dirs remain unchanged).
  - Note that as a result of this, serving the `test` dir and running tests that
    way no longer works, as those entrypoints won't be compiled. You would need
    to configure the `generate_for` to explicitly include `test/**_test.dart`
    to restore that functionality (we will continue pushing on this in the
    future though to restore similar functionality).
  - Also note that the `build_test` package will now output
    `<platform>_test.dart` files based on your [TestOn] annotations, so using
    those where possible will help reduce build platform support warnings as
    well.

### Additional Notes

- Update to run DDC in kernel mode, and consume kernel outlines instead of
  analyzer summaries.
- Skip trying to compile apps that import known incompatible libraries.
- Increased the upper bound for `package:analyzer` to `<0.37.0`.
- Removed support for `build_root_app_summary` configuration option.
- Combine the `ddc_kernel` and `ddc` workers under a single name (`ddc`).
- By default only `.dart.browser_test.dart` files will be compiled under the
  `test` directory, instead of all `_test.dart` files.
  - If you used the previous test debugging workflow in the browser you can
    restore the old behavior with something like the following in your
    build.yaml:

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      build_web_compilers|entrypoint:
        generate_for:
        - test/**_test.dart
        - web/**.dart
```

- Added the `use-incremental-compiler` option for the `build_web_compilers:ddc`
  builder. This is enabled by default but can be disabled if running into build
  issues by setting it to `false` globally:

```yaml
global_options:
  build_web_compilers:ddc:
    options:
      use-incremental-compiler: false
```

- This package now makes its own copy of the `dart_sdk.js` and `require.js`
  files, which it deletes during production builds.
  - In a future build_runner release we will be deleting the entire `$sdk`
    package to resolve some issues with build output bloat.
  - If you are using `dartdevc` as your production compiler, you will need to
    disable the cleanup builder in `build.yaml` (globally) like this:

```yaml
global_options:
  build_web_compilers|sdk_js_cleanup:
    release_options:
      enabled: false
```

  builder, which defaults to `false`.

## 0.3.7+3

- The `dartdevc` compiler now respects the `<base href="/....">` tags and will
  set them as the base url for require js.

## 0.3.7+2

- Fix sdk stack trace folding in the browser console and package:test.

## 0.3.7+1

- Add missing dependency on the `pool` package.

  first when building for an entrypoint.

## 0.3.6

- Add support for compiling with `dart2js` by default in release mode.

## 0.3.5

- Don't ignore cast failures by default. We expect most code to be clean with
  cast failures, and the option can be manually enabled with config.

## 0.3.4+2

- Create `.packages` file and use the new frontend with `dart2js`.

## 0.3.4+1

- Use `--use-old-frontend` with `dart2js` as a stopgap until we can add support
  for `.packages` files.

## 0.3.4

- Added support for dart2js deferred loading.
- Added support for bootstrapping code in web workers with `dartdevc`.

## 0.3.3

- Added support for `--dump-info` and the `dart2js` compiler. If you pass that
  argument with `dart2js_args` the `.info.json` file will be copied the output.

## 0.3.2

- Dart2JS now has minification (`--minify`) enabled by default, similar to how
  it worked in `pub build`. If you are adding custom `dart2js` options, make
  sure you still keep the `--minify` flag. Here is an example:

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      build_web_compilers|entrypoint:
        generate_for:
        - web/**.dart
        options:
          compiler: dart2js
          dart2js_args:
          - --fast-startup
          - --minify
          - --trust-type-annotations
          - --trust-primitives
```

## 0.3.1

- Cast failures will now be ignored in dartdevc by default (these were enabled
  in the latest sdk), and added an `ignore_cast_failures` option to the
  `build_web_compilers|entrypoint` builder which you can set to `true` to enable
  them.
  - At some point in the future it is expected that the default for this will
    flip.

## 0.3.0+1

- Fixed an issue with `dart2js` and the `--no-source-maps` flag.

## 0.3.0

### Breaking changes

- Split `ModuleBuilder`, `UnlinkedSummaryBuilder` and `LinkedSummaryBuilder`
  into a separate `build_modules` package.

## 0.2.1+1

- Support the latest `analyzer` package.

## 0.2.1

- All dart files under `test` are now compiled by default instead of only the
  `_browser_test.dart` files (minus vm/node test bootstrap files). This means
  the original tests can be debugged directly (prior to package:test
  bootstrapping).
- Updated to `package:build` version `0.12.0`.

## 0.2.0

### New Features

- Added support for `dart2js`. This can be configured using the top level
  `compiler` option for the `build_web_compilers|entrypoint` builder. The
  supported options are `dartdevc` (the default) and `dart2js`. Args can be
  passed to `dart2js` using the `dart2js_args` option. For example:

```yaml
targets:
  <my_package>:
    builders:
      build_web_compilers|entrypoint:
        options:
          compiler: dart2js
          dart2js_args:
          - --minify
```

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed `ddc_bootstrap` builder to `entrypoint`, the exposed class also
  changed from `DevCompilerBootstrapBuilder` to `WebEntrypointBuilder`.
- Renamed `jsBootstrapExtension` to `ddcBootstrapExtension` since it is only
  required when using the dev compiler.

## 0.1.1

- Mark `ddc_bootstrap` builder with `build_to: cache`.
- Publish as `build_web_compilers`

## 0.1.0

- Add builder factories.
- Fixed temp dir cleanup bug on windows.
- Enabled support for running tests in --precompiled mode.

## 0.0.1

- Initial release with support for building analyzer summaries and DDC modules.
