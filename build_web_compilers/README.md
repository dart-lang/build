* [Manual Usage](#manual-usage)

## Installation

This package is intended to be used as a [development dependency][] for users
of [`package:build`][] who want to run code in a browser. Simply add the
following to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  build_web_compilers:
```

## Usage

If you are using the autogenerated build script (going through
`dart run build_runner <command>` instead of handwriting a `build.dart` file),
then all you need is the `dev_dependency` listed above.

## Configuration

### Configuring the sound null safety mode

By default [sound null safety][] is enabled or disabled based on the entrypoint
of the app (the file with a `main` function).

You can override this with the `sound_null_safety` option, like this:

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      build_web_compilers:entrypoint:
        options:
          sound_null_safety: false
```

### Configuring the default compiler

By default, the [Dart development compiler][] (_dartdevc_, also known as
_DDC_) will be used.

If you would like to opt into dart2js you will need to add a `build.yaml`
file, which should look roughly like the following:

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      build_web_compilers:entrypoint:
        # These are globs for the entrypoints you want to compile.
        generate_for:
        - test/**.browser_test.dart
        - web/**.dart
        options:
          compiler: dart2js
          # List any dart2js specific args here, or omit it.
          dart2js_args:
          - -O2
```

### Configuring -D environment variables

dartdevc is a modular compiler, so in order to ensure consistent builds
in every module environment variables must be configured globally. Configure
with a mapping in YAML. Environment defined variables can be read with
`const String.fromEnvironment` and `const bool.fromEnvironment`. For example:

```yaml
global_options:
  build_web_compilers:ddc:
    options:
      environment:
        SOME_VAR: some value
        ANOTHER_VAR: false
```

For dart2js, use the `dart2js_args` option. This may be configured globally, or
per target.

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      build_web_compilers:entrypoint:
        options:
          dart2js_args:
          - -DSOME_VAR=some value
          - -DANOTHER_VAR=true
```

These may also be specified on the command line with a `--define` argument.

```sh
webdev serve -- '--define=build_web_compilers:ddc=environment={"SOME_VAR":"changed"}'
```

## Manual Usage

If you are using a custom build script, you will need to add the following
builder applications to what you already have, almost certainly at the end of
the list (unless you need to post-process the js files).

```dart
[
    apply(
        'build_web_compilers:ddc',
        [
        (_) => new ModuleBuilder(),
        (_) => new UnlinkedSummaryBuilder(),
        (_) => new LinkedSummaryBuilder(),
        (_) => new DevCompilerBuilder()
        ],
        toAllPackages(),
        // Recommended, but not required. This makes it so only modules that are
        // imported by entrypoints get compiled.
        isOptional: true,
        hideOutput: true),
    apply('build_web_compilers:entrypoint',
        // You can also use `WebCompiler.Dart2Js`. If you don't care about
        // dartdevc at all you may also omit the previous builder application
        // entirely.
        [(_) => new WebEntrypointBuilder(WebCompiler.DartDevc)], toRoot(),
        hideOutput: true,
        // These globs should match your entrypoints only.
        defaultGenerateFor: const InputSet(
            include: const ['web/**', 'test/**.browser_test.dart'])),
]
```
